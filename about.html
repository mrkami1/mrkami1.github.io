                Hello! My name is Mashhood and i'm currently a student at York University studying Computer Science as my major.
                <br><br>
                Tinkering with hardware and software is something I really enjoy doing, I think its really cool to bring something you made completely
                from scratch to life.
                <br><br>
                I have a lot of experience with a wide variety of programming languages and tools. I currently know Java, C#, C, Python, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. I'm also familiar with Unity 3D and Blender 3D modeling.
                I built this site using these skills!
                <br><br>
                I'm very familiar with Object Oriented Programming, UML design, and algorithms.
                <br><br>
                If you have an opportunity that's available, please visit the contact page and let me know. One more thing; if you're interested, visit my projects page and see what projects i've done so far!
                <br><br><br>
                Thanks!
            </p>

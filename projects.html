            <p>Addressable RGB LED software that allows the user to display different animations and effects, alongside brightness and speed control. It is designed
                to be used by an arduino, and is made to be flexible with any type of arduino IDE compatible device. Those who wish to use this software must have
                a sufficient power supply for the amount of LED's to use since they are quite power hungry when at full brightness and max RGB values. The GUI has
                been created using WinForms and C#. Communication between the software and the arduino uses Serial, and installation and usage has been designed to be
                simple and straightforward.
